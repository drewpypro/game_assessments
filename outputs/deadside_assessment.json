      "summary": "Deadside is developed by Bad Pixel and published jointly by Bad Pixel and tinyBuild on PC and consoles. Multiple databases and the official Steam page consistently list Bad Pixel as the developer and both Bad Pixel and tinyBuild as publishers, with tinyBuild also branding the game under its franchise. Bad Pixel is a small Eastern European studio (commonly described as Russian/Ukrainian in community discussions), while tinyBuild is a well‑known independent publisher headquartered in the United States with a long track record of mid‑budget PC and console titles. Overall, the combination suggests a relatively small but experienced development team backed by an established publisher, which generally aligns with expectations for a mid‑scale online survival shooter.",

      "summary": "Deadside does not list any third‑party DRM such as Denuvo or kernel‑level anti‑cheat on its Steam page or in configuration databases, and PCGamingWiki does not flag any additional DRM beyond standard Steam integration. SteamDB’s configuration for the app does not show external anti‑cheat modules, and community reports about bans reference standard Steam VAC or game bans rather than a proprietary kernel driver. This strongly suggests that Deadside relies on Steam’s built‑in VAC / game‑ban systems and its own server‑side checks, which are considered standard and not kernel‑level invasive compared to systems like BattlEye or Vanguard.",

      "summary": "On Steam, Deadside currently holds an overall \"Mostly Positive\" user review summary, with roughly 76% of English‑language reviews and about 75–78% of all reviews being positive depending on the snapshot. Recent reviews over the last 30 days are also \"Mostly Positive\" at around 77%, indicating stable or slightly improving sentiment since its 1.0 launch. Players frequently praise the game’s realistic gunplay, open‑world survival loop, and active development, while common criticisms focus on bugs, performance issues on some systems, balance concerns, and the grind or toxicity on certain servers. Overall, the community view is that Deadside is a solid survival shooter with room for refinement but a generally enjoyable core experience.",

    "overall_summary": "Deadside is an open‑world survival shooter developed by Bad Pixel and published by Bad Pixel in partnership with established indie publisher tinyBuild, giving it a mix of small‑studio focus and experienced publishing support. Public information and store listings indicate no use of invasive kernel‑level anti‑cheat or heavy third‑party DRM, relying instead on standard Steam VAC / game‑ban mechanisms and server‑side enforcement, which is typical and not considered highly intrusive. On Steam, the game maintains a \"Mostly Positive\" rating with mid‑70s positive percentages overall and in recent reviews, reflecting a generally favorable reception: players appreciate the realistic gunplay and survival systems, while ongoing critiques center on bugs, balance, and server experiences. Taken together, Deadside appears to be a reasonably reputable mid‑scale online title with standard anti‑cheat practices and a broadly positive but still somewhat mixed community sentiment."
