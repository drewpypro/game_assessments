Public listings on Steam, SteamDB, Steambase, and other databases consistently attribute both development and publishing to Funcity, but do not clearly state the company’s country of origin or provide a broader track record of prior releases. As a result, the studio appears to be relatively new or low-profile, with limited available background information, though nothing in the listings suggests obvious red flags beyond the lack of history.",

      "summary": "Available information for Everest: Real Climbing Simulator does not indicate the presence of any third‑party DRM or anti‑cheat solutions such as Denuvo, Easy Anti‑Cheat, or kernel‑level drivers. The Steam store page and tracking sites list standard single‑player features without mentioning online competitive modes or anti‑cheat components, and there is no PCGamingWiki entry or official FAQ detailing additional DRM. Based on this, the game is best characterized as having no notable or invasive anti‑cheat beyond the standard Steam platform DRM.",

Because of this lack of data, there is no established Steam review label or positive percentage, and community sentiment cannot yet be meaningfully assessed.",

    "overall_summary": "Public information for Everest: Real Climbing Simulator indicates that it is developed and published by Funcity, a relatively small and low‑profile studio with limited publicly documented history and no clearly identified country of origin, though multiple independent databases consistently attribute the game to them. No evidence of third‑party or kernel‑level anti‑cheat or additional DRM beyond standard Steam platform protections is present, suggesting a non‑intrusive setup from a technical and privacy standpoint. However, the game is very new, with no Steam user reviews or aggregate scores yet available on major tracking sites, so community sentiment and long‑term reception remain unknown. Overall, identity and ownership are moderately clear, anti‑cheat/DRM risk appears low, but the lack of review data means players should treat expectations about quality and support as tentative."
