      "summary": "Stellaris does not use a dedicated third‑party anti‑cheat solution such as Easy Anti‑Cheat, BattlEye, or kernel‑level drivers. Multiplayer is typically hosted peer‑to‑peer or on user‑run servers, and there is no indication of invasive anti‑cheat or always‑online DRM beyond standard Steam integration on the Steam version. As such, its protections are best characterized as non‑invasive, standard platform DRM rather than a heavy anti‑cheat system.",
