      "summary": "On PC, DOOM: The Dark Ages uses Denuvo Anti‑Tamper as third‑party DRM, as indicated directly on its Steam page and confirmed by multiple coverage sites. There is no indication of kernel‑level anti‑cheat drivers or always‑online anti‑cheat components; the game is a single‑player FPS and can be played offline once activated. While Denuvo is controversial among some PC players for potential performance and preservation concerns, it is generally considered a user‑mode DRM solution rather than a kernel‑level or deeply invasive anti‑cheat system, so it is best classified here as standard rather than invasive.",
