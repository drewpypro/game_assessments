The studio is clearly credited as both developer and publisher on the game’s Steam page and official site, and press coverage highlights it as a narrative-focused team with prior experience on titles like Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us. Its strong critical reception, rapid sales growth, and prominent media coverage suggest a reputable and professionally run developer-publisher operation aligned with expectations for a polished AA narrative game.",

      "summary": "Dispatch is a single‑player, narrative-driven adventure game released on Steam and PS5, and there is no indication on its Steam store page, official website, or major coverage that it uses any dedicated anti-cheat or third‑party DRM such as Denuvo or kernel‑level solutions. The game is positioned as a story-focused experience without competitive multiplayer, so it would not typically require invasive anti‑cheat. In the absence of any references to additional DRM beyond standard platform protections, it is reasonable to treat Dispatch as having no notable or intrusive anti‑cheat/DRM beyond what Steam and PS5 normally provide.",
