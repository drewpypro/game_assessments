      "summary": "Super Mario Bros. is an offline, single-player (with alternating multiplayer) platform game originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, and it does not use any modern anti-cheat or third-party DRM systems such as Denuvo or kernel-level anti-cheat. Its various re-releases on Nintendo platforms are handled through Nintendo’s own system-level licensing and emulation rather than intrusive PC-style anti-cheat solutions. As such, there is no indication of invasive anti-cheat or DRM associated with this title.",

    "overall_summary": "The assessment for Super Mario Bros. is highly confident regarding identity and ownership: it is developed by Nintendo R&D4 and published by Nintendo, a major and reputable Japanese game company. The game predates modern PC anti-cheat and DRM systems and is primarily an offline console title, so there is effectively no invasive anti-cheat or DRM to be concerned about. However, because Super Mario Bros. is not available on Steam, there are no Steam review labels or percentages to reference, which lowers confidence and scoring for the community sentiment dimension despite the game’s broadly acclaimed status in wider gaming culture. Overall, the title scores very strongly on identity and anti-cheat considerations, with limited data only in the Steam-specific community metrics."
