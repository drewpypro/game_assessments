### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 4/5)

Available information about the PRAGMATA Sketchbook demo on Steam focuses on its story, combat, platforms, and performance, with no mention of third‑party DRM such as Denuvo or any kernel‑level or always‑on anti‑cheat. As a primarily single‑player sci‑fi action‑adventure demo, it is very likely to rely only on standard Steam DRM without additional anti‑cheat components, so it appears non‑intrusive from an anti‑cheat/DRM standpoint.

**Anti-cheat type:** none  
**Classification:** none

### Community Sentiment (Score: 2/5)

Steam label: **unknown**  
Positive review %: **unknown**

The Pragmata Sketchbook demo has only just been released on Steam, and aggregate user review data such as an overall review label or positive percentage is not yet consistently reported by third‑party trackers. Early coverage from outlets and hands‑on previews is generally positive about the demo’s performance and unique hacking‑focused combat, but there is not enough consolidated Steam review data to state a clear community sentiment score at this time.
