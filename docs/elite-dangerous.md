## Key Summary

Elite Dangerous is a long‑running online space sim developed and self‑published by the established UK studio Frontier Developments, giving it a clear and reputable ownership profile. The game appears to rely on standard platform DRM and server‑side checks rather than invasive kernel‑level anti‑cheat, suggesting a typical level of intrusiveness for an always‑online title. Community sentiment on Steam is generally positive, with a "Mostly Positive" overall rating and roughly three‑quarters of reviews recommending the game; players praise its scale and freedom while often criticizing grind, complexity, and some contentious updates and monetization choices. Overall, Elite Dangerous presents as a well‑known, stable live service game with solid but occasionally polarized community perceptions.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 80/5)

Available public information indicates that Elite Dangerous does not bundle a named third‑party anti‑cheat solution such as Easy Anti‑Cheat, BattlEye, or kernel‑level drivers, nor does it use intrusive DRM like Denuvo on Steam. The game relies on always‑online server‑side validation and standard platform DRM (Steam/Epic/Frontier accounts) to manage access and discourage cheating. As a result, its protections are best described as standard online/server‑side measures rather than invasive kernel‑level anti‑cheat.

**Anti-cheat type:** none  
**Classification:** standard
