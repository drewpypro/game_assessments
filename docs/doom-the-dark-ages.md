## Key Summary

DOOM: The Dark Ages is a 2025 single‑player FPS developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks, both well‑established U.S. studios with a long history on the DOOM franchise, giving the game a very strong identity and ownership profile. On PC it employs Denuvo Anti‑Tamper DRM, which is controversial but operates as a standard user‑mode DRM solution rather than a kernel‑level or highly invasive anti‑cheat system. Community sentiment on Steam is strongly positive, with a "Very Positive" label and roughly 85% positive reviews, reflecting broad approval of its combat, presentation, and scope, tempered by some criticism of pacing, puzzles, and the presence of Denuvo. Overall, the title appears to be a reputable, well‑received AAA release with moderate DRM concerns for some PC players.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 6/5)

On PC, DOOM: The Dark Ages uses Denuvo Anti‑Tamper as third‑party DRM, as indicated directly on its Steam page and confirmed by multiple coverage sites. There is no indication of kernel‑level anti‑cheat drivers or always‑online anti‑cheat components; the game is a single‑player FPS and can be played offline once activated. While Denuvo is controversial among some PC players for potential performance and preservation concerns, it is generally considered a user‑mode DRM solution rather than a kernel‑level or deeply invasive anti‑cheat system, so it is best classified here as standard rather than invasive.

**Anti-cheat type:** Denuvo Anti-Tamper (DRM)  
**Classification:** standard
