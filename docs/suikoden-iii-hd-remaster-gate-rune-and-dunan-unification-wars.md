## Dimensions

### Identity & Ownership (Score: 95/5)

Suikoden I&II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars is developed and published by Konami, a long-established Japanese game company known for major franchises such as Metal Gear, Castlevania, and the original Suikoden series. Official materials and databases list KONAMI as both developer and publisher for this remaster collection, and the project is clearly positioned as a first‑party revival of Konami’s own classic JRPG IP.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 90/5)

Available public information for Suikoden I&II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars does not indicate the presence of any third‑party DRM beyond the standard platform DRM (such as Steam’s built‑in system), nor any dedicated anti‑cheat solution like Denuvo, Easy Anti‑Cheat, or kernel‑level drivers. The game is a single‑player JRPG collection without competitive online features, and technical overviews focus on engine choice (Unity) and quality‑of‑life improvements rather than online services or anti‑cheat. In the absence of any evidence of additional DRM or anti‑cheat layers, it is reasonable to classify the game as having no notable or invasive anti‑cheat beyond normal storefront protections.
