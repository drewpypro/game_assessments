The company previously released Craftopia and has grown rapidly in visibility due to Palworld’s massive commercial success and high concurrent player counts. While still relatively young compared to major AAA publishers, Pocketpair appears to be a legitimate and increasingly established developer with a strong track record of supporting Palworld through frequent updates and active community communication, broadly aligning with expectations for a modern, service-style survival game.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 80/5)

Available public information for Palworld does not indicate the use of third‑party kernel‑level anti‑cheat or heavy DRM solutions such as Denuvo. The Steam store page does not list additional DRM beyond the standard Steam platform, and community and press coverage focus on gameplay, performance, and content updates rather than any invasive anti‑cheat drivers or always‑online DRM requirements. Based on this, Palworld appears to rely on standard platform‑level protections and in‑game server logic rather than intrusive anti‑cheat, and its anti‑cheat/DRM profile can be considered typical and non‑invasive for a multiplayer survival title.

**Anti-cheat type:** none  
**Classification:** standard

### Community Sentiment (Score: 90/5)

Steam label: **Very Positive (Recent), Overwhelmingly Positive (English Overall)**  
Positive review %: **93% recent, 95% English overall**

On Steam, Palworld currently holds a Very Positive recent review label with roughly 93% positive reviews in the last 30 days, while English overall reviews are rated Overwhelmingly Positive at about 95% positive. This reflects a strong and improving community sentiment, especially compared to the more mixed discourse around launch balancing and bugs. Players frequently praise the blend of monster‑taming and survival crafting, the breadth of content, and the steady cadence of updates, while common criticisms focus on early‑access rough edges, balance issues, and debates over design similarities to other franchises. Overall, the community response is highly favorable and trending upward as the game continues to be updated.
