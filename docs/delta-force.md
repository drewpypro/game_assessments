# Assessment: Delta Force

**Type:** Game  
**Date:** 2025-11-29T00:00:00Z  
**Overall Score:** 6/5

## Key Summary

Delta Force (the current free-to-play tactical shooter on Steam) is a well-documented title developed by Team Jade and published by TiMi Studio Group, a major Chinese studio under Tencent, so its identity and ownership are clear and backed by large, established organizations. However, the game uses Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) in a kernel-level configuration, which is considered invasive and may be a concern for privacy- and security-conscious players. Community sentiment on Steam is mixed, with roughly two-thirds of players leaving positive reviews overall but more recent feedback trending lower, reflecting a split between those who enjoy the large-scale, combined-arms gameplay and Black Hawk Down campaign and those frustrated by technical issues, balance, monetization, and the invasive anti-cheat. Taken together, the game scores strongly on identity transparency but more modestly on community reception and poorly on anti-cheat intrusiveness, leading to an overall moderate risk/concern profile for cautious users.

## Dimensions

### Identity & Ownership (Score: 9/5)

The current free-to-play tactical shooter Delta Force on Steam is developed by Team Jade and published by TiMi Studio Group, both part of Tencent’s game development ecosystem and based in China. TiMi is a large, established mobile and cross-platform developer and publisher known for titles like Call of Duty: Mobile and Honor of Kings, and Team Jade is one of its internal studios focused on realistic military shooters. While the broader organization is highly reputable and well-resourced, the new Delta Force has drawn some criticism and scrutiny, including a recent incident where the studio apologized after being accused of copying an asset from Rust, which may slightly temper perceptions of polish and originality but does not fundamentally undermine the legitimacy of the developer or publisher.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 3/5)

On its Steam page, the current Delta Force lists that it "Uses Kernel Level Anti-Cheat" and specifies Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) as the solution, which is a Tencent-associated kernel-level anti-cheat system. Kernel-level anti-cheat operates with very high privileges on the user’s system and is generally considered more invasive than standard user-mode or purely server-side solutions, as it can monitor low-level system activity and remains active while the game is running. While this approach can improve cheat detection, it raises privacy and security concerns for some players, so the game’s anti-cheat should be regarded as invasive rather than lightweight DRM or basic anti-cheat.

**Anti-cheat type:** Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE)  
**Classification:** invasive

### Community Sentiment (Score: 5/5)

Steam label: **Mixed**  
Positive review %: **65%**

On Steam, Delta Force currently carries a "Mixed" overall user review label, with approximately 65% of all user reviews marked as positive and a more recent 30-day window showing a lower positive ratio around the high 40s. This indicates a divided community: many players praise the large-scale combined-arms battles, weapon feel, and the nostalgic Black Hawk Down campaign remake, while others criticize technical issues, balance concerns, monetization worries, and the reliance on kernel-level anti-cheat. Overall sentiment suggests that the core gameplay appeals strongly to a substantial audience, but ongoing polish, performance improvements, and trust around security and progression systems are key themes in community feedback.
