**Date:** 2026-02-05T00:00:00Z  
**Overall Score:** 4/5

## Key Summary

Agent 64: Spies Never Die is an upcoming retro FPS developed and self‑published by indie creator Replicant D6, with consistent attribution across Steam and third‑party databases but limited public information about the studio’s country or broader history. There is no evidence of additional DRM or invasive anti‑cheat beyond standard Steam platform features, which is favorable from a privacy and control standpoint. Because the game has not yet released and has no Steam user reviews, community sentiment cannot be reliably measured, though pre‑release interest appears solid. Overall, the title looks promising and low‑risk from an ownership and anti‑cheat perspective, with the main unknown being future player reception once it launches.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 5/5)

There is no indication that Agent 64: Spies Never Die uses any third‑party anti‑cheat or intrusive DRM such as Denuvo or kernel‑level systems. The Steam store page and related databases list standard Steam distribution details without mentioning additional DRM or anti‑cheat middleware, and the game is primarily a single‑player and co‑op/PvP FPS without competitive, ranked, or free‑to‑play elements that typically drive invasive anti‑cheat adoption. It is therefore reasonable to classify the game as having no notable anti‑cheat or DRM beyond the standard Steam platform layer.

**Anti-cheat type:** none  
**Classification:** none

Positive review %: **unknown**

As of early 2026, Agent 64: Spies Never Die has not yet released on Steam and currently shows no user reviews, so there is no official Steam review summary label or aggregate positive percentage available. The game has a visible following and interest, as reflected by wishlists and coverage on news and stats sites, but formal community sentiment via Steam reviews cannot yet be assessed.
