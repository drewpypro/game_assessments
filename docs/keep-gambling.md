## Key Summary

KEEP GAMBLING is an indie multiplayer gambling-themed title developed and published by WIRED FEELINGS, a small studio with limited publicly available background information but an active presence on Steam.

There are no mentions of invasive or kernel-level components, suggesting that KEEP GAMBLING relies only on Steam’s normal platform features and does not employ a separate anti-cheat system.
