## Key Summary

ARC Raiders is a high-profile extraction shooter developed and published by Swedish studio Embark Studios, an established and well-resourced team with a strong industry pedigree and backing. Community sentiment on Steam is very positive, with roughly 89% positive reviews and record-setting concurrent player counts, indicating a broadly satisfied and active player base despite some concerns about monetization and long-term content for heavy players. The main caveat is the use of kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat, which is effective but more invasive than standard DRM or user-mode anti-cheat and may be a concern for privacy- and security-conscious users. Overall, the game appears reputable and well-received, but prospective players should be comfortable with kernel-level anti-cheat.

### Identity & Ownership (Score: 5/5)

ARC Raiders is developed and published by Embark Studios, a Swedish studio founded by former DICE/Battlefield veterans and owned by Nexon. The studio is relatively new but already established through prior releases like The Finals, and it operates as Embark Studios AB out of Sweden. Given its backing, prior shipped titles, and strong critical and commercial reception for ARC Raiders, the developer / publisher appears reputable and aligned with expectations for a modern, large-scale multiplayer shooter.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 2/5)

According to the Steam store page, ARC Raiders uses Easy Anti-Cheat with a kernel-level component, and the listing notes that Easy Anti-Cheat requires manual removal after uninstalling the game. Kernel-level anti-cheat is generally considered more invasive than standard user-mode solutions because it operates with high system privileges and may persist beyond game uninstallation unless explicitly removed. While this is a common approach for competitive online games, privacy- and security-conscious users may view it as intrusive.

**Anti-cheat type:** Easy Anti-Cheat (kernel-level)  
**Classification:** invasive
