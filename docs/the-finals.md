## Key Summary

THE FINALS is a free-to-play, team-based FPS developed and published by Embark Studios, a Swedish studio owned by Nexon, giving it a clear and well-documented identity and ownership. The game uses Easy Anti-Cheat with kernel-level access, which is effective but relatively invasive compared to standard user-mode anti-cheat solutions, potentially raising privacy or control concerns for some players.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 40/5)

According to the Steam store page, THE FINALS uses Easy Anti-Cheat and explicitly notes that it "Uses Kernel Level Anti-Cheat" and that Easy Anti-Cheat requires manual removal after uninstalling the game. Kernel-level anti-cheat operates with high system privileges and is generally considered more intrusive than standard user-mode solutions, even though it is common in competitive online shooters. Based on this, THE FINALS’ anti-cheat is best classified as invasive from a privacy and system-access standpoint, despite being a widely used commercial solution.

**Anti-cheat type:** Easy Anti-Cheat (kernel-level)  
**Classification:** invasive
